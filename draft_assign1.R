# •Create two points in the geographic CRS WGS 84 (EPSG: 4326) using the following latitude and longitude:
#   •(A) longitude: 11.56362 , latitude: 48.12791
#   •(B) longitude: -8.63953, latitude: 41.155140



# 1. Compute the distance between these points in these four settings:
#   
#   (1)Great circle distance
# (2)Project into the projected CRS Pseudo-Mercator WGS 84 (EPSG: 3857) and compute the Euclidean distance
# (3)Project into the projected CRS LAEA (Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area) Europe (EPSG: 3035) and compute the Euclidean distance
# (4) Project into the projected CRS ED 1950 Equidistant Conic Europe  Europe (ESRI:102031) and compute the Euclidean distance (authority ESRI – thus, set the crs parameter as crs=“ESRI: 102031“)
# 


# 2. Explain in a few sentences, why these results are different. Which is the least correct?
#   
#   
#   (answer consists of 5 subtasks – 4 numbers and one textual explanation.)
